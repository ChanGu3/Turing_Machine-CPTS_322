# Turing_Machine-CPTS_322
Solo project to Simulate a Turing Machine Created In A Software Engineering Principles 1 Class 

# The Completed Project In Course
The completed Project in C++ resulted In an Console Application
- The Application takes a string file and a Turing Machine Definition file.
- To start application it requires a Turing Machine Definition file and an optional string file with same name but different exstension when running in console.
- The application allows user to navigate a menu of their currently loaded Turing Machine.
- string file can be used to insert a string into Turing Machine.
- The Turing Machine will tell the user if the string is accepted or rejected by the Turing Machine Definition provided by the user.
- When exiting the application a string file will be saved if a user edited strings from the stored string in memory from a already existing string file or from user input.

# Ideas To-Do
- Implement Turing Machine To go infinitely to the right
- Implement Non-Determinism
